# mitu-workshop-transcriptions

These materials are draft items for the eventual production of an Open Educational Resource for the purposes of phonetic transcription teaching and practice. The recordings used here were produced from materials in the Elsa GÃ³mez-Imbert Tucanoan Languages Collection at the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas (https://islandora-ailla.lib.utexas.edu/islandora/object/ailla:274825). 

The recordings are of vocabulary elicitation sessions performed in Spanish with speakers of various Indigenous languages of Colombia.

At present the files include

EGI-091-b.mp3 - An mp3 version of the original archival audio file.
EGI-091-b.eaf - A time-aligned Elan annotation file.
EGI-091-b.TextGrid - A time-aligned Praat annotation file.
clips-sample.zip - 10 audio clips in WAV format of responses to single elicitation prompts.
